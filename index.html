        <h2>
          Here's a time line of Pr. Stefansson's life:
        </h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>1917</strong>
             - Baldur R. Stefansson was born at Vestfold near Lundar, Manitoba to Gudmundur and Jonina Stefansson, immigrants from Iceland.  He was one of ten children in the family.  Baldur married Sigriður J.M. Westdal. They had three children – Björgvin, Helga, and Paul.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1938</strong>
             - Like many of his contemporaries, his education was interrupted by the hard times of the 1930’s, and did not progress past Grade 9.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1939</strong>
             - He joined the army.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1945</strong>
             - After the war, he was able to finish school with assistance from the army, completing grades 10, 11, and 12 in a single year.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1949</strong>
             - He then enrolled in the University of Manitoba’s faculty of Agriculture and received a Diploma
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1950</strong>
             - BSA
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1952</strong>
             - Masters Degree
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1953</strong>
             - Stefansson began his research in the early 1950’s to create a variety of rapeseed oil as an edible product to replace the soybean oil and palm oil Canada was importing. It was important that the new plant yield a high quality edible oil and low levels of erucic acid and glucosinolates that would allow the rapeseed pulp to be used as animal feed.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1966</strong>
             - He completed a PhD

             - Stefansson registered the new plant called Tower, the first “double zero” variety, low in both erucic acid and glucosinolates. Other researchers soon followed with newer varieties. Canola (Canadian Oil) owes its origin to more than one researcher, but Baldur Stefansson was at the forefront of the research involved.
